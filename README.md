In today's digital age, effective management tools are crucial for the success of any business especially in the fitness industry
me and my team we developed using HTML and CSS a website (Front-End) for a gym management system called I GYM
which is an app for desktop and mobile phones, the website aims to revolutionize how gyms operate
offering seamless management solutions tailored to enhance efficiency, member experience, and administrative ease.

I uploaded the HTML & CSS codes I worked on for my part in this group project
along with the images folder used in this section of website.

I uploaded also a video showing the whole final website with all the sections together.
